# cliifs
**Command Line Interface Iterated Function Systems**

Render and view fractals from iterated functions systems right on your terminal.

# How To Use
cliifs reads in a plaintext file that contains the univariate linear functions you wish to use for your IFS.

The first line must begin with `2D`. The following lines each represent a linear function `f(x) = mx+b`.

Each function line contains the coefficients `a` and `b`, which are seperated by a single space.

See example files for details.
